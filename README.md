- create a new student which includes the student's:
    * formal name
    * nickname (name preference)
    * email address
- delete a student
- list all students and their information
- create a new word assigned to a specific student's word list that includes:
    * the spelling of the word
    * its POS (part of speech)
    * its definition
    * several sentences using the word.
- list a student's wordlist identified by the student's name
- list all words for all the students
- delete a word from a student's list
- delete a student's entire word list when the student is deleted
