                NOTE 2 separate times, refreshing window does not clear a console log, I had to re-open the html file in the browser to clear the log

Q1 ]]
How to debug backend to check that information is being posted correctly to create a Word
** Rails server terminal error:    Unpermitted parameter: :student_id
** Completed 422 Unprocessable Entity in 2ms

Q2 ]]
In the wordFormSubmission function, the fetch Post for words is not working. Why?

Q3 ]]
NOTE Do I build actions in the controller for these has_many paths

To display a student's list of words on click [this.words], I need the path =>>     /students/:id/words

    But I can't find a path in =>>  http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes
    HOWEVER In the rails console Student.all[0].words
            brings up an array of all of Abe's words
    BUT     Also in the rails console Student.all[0]
            Does NOT show any indication that Abe has words
            
        -- OR --

To display list of words for ALL individual students after DOM load [NOTE I successfully fetched an array of word objects]
    - I need a class array of all students that I can iterate over and add their words to their word list

 Word.all[0].student.name           =>  "Abraham A."

READ Student Steps
    - Add a students-container <div> to append list of students to
    - Set up event listener to trigger READ (in DOMContentLoaded or another called function)
    - Create fetch function (auto GET) data from a URL address
    - Reassemble the returned data
    - Create instance(s) with the returned data
    - Call an instance render method on (each) instance to display instance(s)


CREATE Student Steps
    - Add a student-form <div> to append create new student form to
    - Create a form function and set up event listener in it to trigger CREATE
    - Create a submission function to fetch POST data to URL address
    - Reassemble returned data
    - Create an instance with the returned data
    - Call an instance render method on the instance to display it


DELETE Student Steps
    - Add a delete button with an onclick listener to the renderStudent method in the Student class
    - Create deleteStudent function that uses event to drill down to the dataset id of the specific student =>> event.target.dataset.id
    - Change dataset id to a number =>> parseInt(event.target.dataset.id)
    - Use the dataset id number in the fetch URL address =>> method: "DELETE"
    - Instantly display result with:    this.location.reload()

====================================

CREATE Word Steps
    - Add =>> (add word button with an onclick listener) to the renderStudent method in the Student class
    - Create a showForm function to hide student related divs and call to show the form
    - Create a form function and set up event listener in it to trigger CREATE
    - Create a submission function fo fetch POST data to URL address


READ Word Steps


DELETE Word Steps






====================================

ORIGINAL Page Reload:       this.location.reload()


    // let hideStudents = document.getElementById("container")
    // hideStudents.style.display = "none";

    // let word = new Word(apiWord.spelling, apiWord.pos, apiWord.definition, apiWord.sentence, apiWord.student_id)
    // word.renderWord();

    // let deleteWordForm = document.getElementById("word-form")
    // deleteWordForm.innerHTML = ""

ToDo List
GENERAL
    - Refactor to empty out the index.js file as much as possible
    - practice for assessment: walk through explaining how the app works
    - handle errors & bad input
    - use CSS to style the webpage

WORD
    âœ… use [ this.location.reload() ] to add a cancel button to add a word to redirect to main page without creating a word
    - use student's name to identify their word list
    - handle empty form box entries


STUDENT
    - handle empty form box entries

















To display a student's list of words on click [this.words], I need the path =>>     /students/:id/words
