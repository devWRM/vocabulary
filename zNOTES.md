How to debug backend to check that information is being posted correctly to create a Word
** Rails server terminal error:    Unpermitted parameter: :student_id
** Completed 422 Unprocessable Entity in 2ms

Q2 ]]
In the wordFormSubmission function, the fetch Post for words is not working. Why?

Q3 ]]
NOTE Do I build actions in the controller for these has_many paths

To display a student's list of words on click [this.words], I need the path =>>     /students/:id/words

    But I can't find a path in =>>  http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes
    HOWEVER In the rails console Student.all[0].words
            brings up an array of all of Abe's words
    BUT     Also in the rails console Student.all[0]
            Does NOT show any indication that Abe has words
            
        -- OR --

To display list of words for ALL individual students after DOM load [NOTE I successfully fetched an array of word objects]
    - I need a class array of all students that I can iterate over and add their words to their word list

READ Student Steps
    - Add a students-container <div> to append list of students to
    - Set up event listener to trigger READ (in DOMContentLoaded or another called function)
    - Create fetch function (auto GET) data from a URL address
    - Reassemble the returned data
    - Create instance(s) with the returned data
    - Call an instance render method on (each) instance to display instance(s)

    - Use the dataset id number in the fetch URL address =>> method: "DELETE"
