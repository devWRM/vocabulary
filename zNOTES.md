Q2 ]]
In the wordFormSubmission function, the fetch Post for words is not working. Why?

Q3 ]]
NOTE Do I build actions in the controller for these has_many paths

To display a student's list of words on click [this.words], I need the path =>>     /students/:id/words

    But I can't find a path in =>>  http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes
    HOWEVER In the rails console Student.all[0].words
            brings up an array of all of Abe's words
    BUT     Also in the rails console Student.all[0]
            Does NOT show any indication that Abe has words
            
        -- OR --

To display list of words for ALL individual students after DOM load [NOTE I successfully fetched an array of word objects]
    - I need a class array of all students that I can iterate over and add their words to their word list

READ Student Steps
    - Add a students-container <div> to append list of students to
    - Set up event listener to trigger READ (in DOMContentLoaded or another called function)
    - Create fetch function (auto GET) data from a URL address
    - Reassemble the returned data
    - Create instance(s) with the returned data
    - Call an instance render method on (each) instance to display instance(s)


CREATE Student Steps
    - Add a student-form <div> to append create new student form to
    - Create a form function and set up event listener in it to trigger CREATE
    - Create a submission function to fetch POST data to URL address
    - Reassemble returned data
    - Create an instance with the returned data
    - Call an instance render method on the instance to display it


DELETE Student Steps
    - Add a delete button with an onclick listener to the renderStudent method in the Student class
    - Create deleteStudent function that uses event to drill down to the dataset id of the specific student =>> event.target.dataset.id
    - Change dataset id to a number =>> parseInt(event.target.dataset.id)
    - Use the dataset id number in the fetch URL address =>> method: "DELETE"
    - Instantly display result with:    this.location.reload()

====================================

CREATE Word Steps
    - Add =>> (add word button with an onclick listener) to the renderStudent method in the Student class
    - Create a showForm function to hide student related divs and call to show the form
    - Create a form function and set up event listener in it to trigger CREATE
    - Create a submission function fo fetch POST data to URL address


READ Word Steps


DELETE Word Steps






====================================

ORIGINAL Page Reload:       this.location.reload()


    // let hideStudents = document.getElementById("container")
    // hideStudents.style.display = "none";

    // let word = new Word(apiWord.spelling, apiWord.pos, apiWord.definition, apiWord.sentence, apiWord.student_id)
    // word.renderWord();

    // let deleteWordForm = document.getElementById("word-form")
    // deleteWordForm.innerHTML = ""

====================================





















To display a student's list of words on click [this.words], I need the path =>>     /students/:id/words

PRY THE BACKEND in the Controller files
In Gemfile                      gem 'pry'
cd into backend then run        bundle install
run                             rails s
insert in controller action     binding.pry
(run the app)
to exit pry, iTTT               exit    or      Q


iTTT    In a binding pry, looking at variables:

[1] pry(#<StudentsController>)> @student
=> #<Student:0x00007ff5f65e7600

[2] pry(#<StudentsController>)> @student.valid?
=> false

[3] pry(#<StudentsController>)> @student.errors
=> #<ActiveModel::Errors:0x00007ff5f218ea30

[4] pry(#<StudentsController>)> @student.errors.full_messages.to_sentence
=> "Name can't be blank, Nickname can't be blank, and Email can't be blank"
[5] pry(#<StudentsController>)> exit

NOTE Can there be 2 fetches inside one function ??
In the fetchSingleWordList function:

let studId = parseInt(event.target.dataset.id)
    let studName = function(studId) {

        fetch(`${BASE_URL}/students/${studId}`)
        .then(resp => resp.json())
        .then(apiStudent => { // console.log(apiStudent)

            let s = new Student(apiStudent.id, apiStudent.name, apiStudent.nickname, apiStudent.email)
            return s.nickname
        }
